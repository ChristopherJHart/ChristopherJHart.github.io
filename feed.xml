This can lead to faulty troubleshooting, as network engineers might attempt to correlate data plane connectivity issues with control plane connectivity issues. In this post, we will investigate the concepts of the data, co... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Understanding Load Balancing on Network Devices</title><link href="https://www.chrisjhart.com/Understanding-Load-Balancing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Understanding Load Balancing on Network Devices" /><published>2021-10-24T00:00:00-04:00</published> <updated>2021-10-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.chrisjhart.com/Understanding-Load-Balancing/</id> <content src="https://www.chrisjhart.com/Understanding-Load-Balancing/" /> <author> <name>Christopher Hart</name> </author> <summary> A common misunderstanding engineers have about Equal-Cost Multi-Pathing (ECMP) and port-channels is that they increase the bandwidth that can be used between two network devices. This can be true, but isn’t always true. In this post, we’ll explore an example scenario where the total bandwidth is not increased as a result of implementing a port-channel, as well as how load-balancing really works... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Normalizing JSON Data Structure Output on Cisco NX-OS with Python</title><link href="https://www.chrisjhart.com/Normalizing-JSON-Data-Structure-Output-On-Cisco-NX-OS-With-Python/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Normalizing JSON Data Structure Output on Cisco NX-OS with Python" /><published>2021-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</published> <updated>2021-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://www.chrisjhart.com/Normalizing-JSON-Data-Structure-Output-On-Cisco-NX-OS-With-Python/</id> <content src="https://www.chrisjhart.com/Normalizing-JSON-Data-Structure-Output-On-Cisco-NX-OS-With-Python/" /> <author> <name>Christopher Hart</name> </author> <summary> Earlier this year, Ivan Pepelnjak wrote a blog post on how the way network operating systems (including Cisco’s NX-OS) convert XML-based data structures to JSON can cause certain keys to be either a dictionary or a list, depending on the quantity of elements nested within a parent element. Ivan’s blog post does an excellent job of providing multiple workarounds for this issue, such as using an ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
